### Note:

- It convert media on server. And I don't have a good option for now. So the backend server url can change frequently, You can watch this repo, and when the server url updated, you will be notified. BTW, you can deploy your own backend for free (Using Heroku üòÅ).

### Deploy your own backend:

There are many options, You can install ffmpeg and nodejs in your system and run it (`npm start`) natively. Or, can use docker as well (Go to backend folder and make it). But for your personal uses, heroku is enough. To deploy it with heroku follow these steps:

- Click It & Deploy üëá
